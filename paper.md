# Summary

Graph Network-based Simulator (GNS) is a framework for developing generalizable, efficient, and accurate machine learning (ML)-based surrogate models for particulate and fluid systems using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).  GNNs are the state-of-the-art geometric deep learning (GDL) that operates on graphs to represent rich relational information[@scarselli2008graph], which maps an input graph to an output graph with the same structure but potentially different node, edge, and global feature attributes.  The graph network in GNS spans the physical domain with nodes representing an individual or a collection of particles, and the edges connecting the vertices representing the local interaction between particles or clusters of particles.  The GNS computes the system dynamics via learned message passing.  \autoref{fig:gns} shows an overview of how GNS learns to simulate n-body dynamics.  The GNS has three components: (a) Encoder, which embeds particle information to a latent graph, the edges represent learned functions; (b) Processor, which allows data propagation and computes the nodal interactions across steps; and (c) Decoder, which extracts the relevant dynamics (e.g., particle acceleration) from the graph.  The GNS learns the dynamics, such as momentum and energy exchange, through a form of messages passing [@gilmer2017neural], where latent information propagates between nodes via the graph edges.  The GNS edge messages  ($e^\prime_k \leftarrow \phi^e(e_k, v_{r_k}, v_{s_k}, u)$) are a learned linear combination of the interaction forces.  The edge messages are aggregated at every node exploiting the principle of superposition $\bar{e_i^\prime} \leftarrow \sum_{r_k = i} e_i^\prime$.  The node then encodes the connected edge features and its local features using a neural network: $v_i^\prime \leftarrow \phi^v (\bar{e_i}, v_i, u)$.

The GNS implementation uses semi-implicit Euler integration to update the state of the particles based on the nodes predicted accelerations.  We introduce physics-inspired simple inductive biases, such as an inertial frame that allows learning algorithms to prioritize one solution over another (instead of learning to predict the inertial motion, the neural network learns to trivially predict a correction to the inertial trajectory, reducing learning time.  We developed an open-source, PyTorch-based GNS that predicts the dynamics of fluid and particulate systems[@Kumar_Graph_Network_Simulator_2022].  GNS trained on trajectory data is generalizable to predict particle kinematics in complex boundary conditions not seen during training.  \autoref{fig:gns-mpm} shows the GNS prediction of granular flow around complex obstacles trained on 20 million steps with 40 trajectories on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.  The trained model accurately predicts within 5\% error of its associated material point method (MPM) simulation.

# Statement of need

Traditional numerical methods for solving differential equations are invaluable in scientific and engineering disciplines.  However, such simulators are computationally expensive and intractable for solving large-scale and complex inverse problems, multiphysics, and multi-scale mechanics.  Surrogate models trade off generality for accuracy in a narrow setting.  Recent growth in data availability has spurred data-driven machine learning (ML) models that train directly from observed data [@prume2022model].  ML models require significant training data to cover the large state space and complex dynamics.  Instead of ignoring the vast amount of structured prior knowledge (physics), we can exploit such knowledge to construct physics-informed ML algorithms with limited training data.  GNS uses static and inertial priors to learn the interactions between particles directly on graphs and can generalize with limited training data [@wu2020comprehensive;@velivckovic2017graph].  Graph-based GNS offer powerful data representations of real-world applications, including particulate systems, material sciences, drug discovery, astrophysics, and engineering [@sanchez2020learning;@battaglia2018relational].

# State of the art

@sanchez2020learning developed a reference GNS implementation based on TensorFlow v1 [@tensorflow2015whitepaper].  Although the reference implementation runs both on CPU and GPU, it doesn't achieve multi-GPU scaling.  Furthermore, the dependence on TensorFlow v1 limits its ability to leverage features such as eager execution in TF v2.  We develop a scalable and modular GNS using PyTorch using the Distributed Data Parallel model to run on multi-GPU systems.

# Key features 

The Graph Network Simulator (GNS) uses PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric for constructing graphs and learned message passing. GNS is highly-scalable to 100,000 vertices and more than a million edges. The PyTorch GNS supports the following features:

- CPU and GPU training
- Parallel training on multi-GPUs
- Multi-material interactions
- Complex boundary conditions
- Checkpoint restart
- VTK results
- Animation postprocessing

# GNS training and prediction

GNS models are trained on 1000s of particle trajectories from MPM (for sands) and Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (for water) for 20 million steps. 

## Dataset format

We use the numpy `.npz` format for storing positional data for GNS training.  The `.npz` format includes a list of tuples of arbitrary length where each tuple corresponds to a differenet training trajectory and is of the form `(position, particle_type)`.  The data loader provides `INPUT_SEQUENCE_LENGTH` positions, set equal to six by default, to provide the GNS with the last `INPUT_SEQUENCE_LENGTH` minus one positions as input to predict the position at the next time step.  The `position` is a 3-D tensor of shape `(n_time_steps, n_particles, n_dimensions)` and `particle_type` is a 1-D tensor of shape `(n_particles)`.  

The dataset contains:

# Parallelization and scaling

The GNS is parallelized to run across multiple GPUs using the PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) model.  The DDP model spawns as many GNS models as the number of GPUs, distributing the dataset across all GPU nodes.  Consider, our training dataset with 20 simulations, each with 206 time steps of positional data $x_i$, which yields $(206 - 6) * 20 = 4000$ training trajectories.  We subtract six position from the GNS training dataset as we utilize five previous velocities, computed from six positions, to predict the next position.  The 4000 training tajectories are subsequently distributed equally to the four GPUs (1000 training trajectories/GPU).  Assuming a batch size of 2, each GPU handles 500 trajectories in a batch.  The loss from the training trajectories are computed as

$$f(\theta) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (GNS_\theta(x_t^i) - a_t^i)\,,$$

where $n$ is the number of particles (nodes) and $\theta$ is the learnable parameter in the GNS. In DDP, the gradient $\nabla (f(\theta))$ is computed as the average gradient across all GPUs as shown in \autoref{fig:gns-ddp}.

A test of the GNS's scalability was performed on a node of Lonestar 6 at the Texas Advanced Computing Center equipped with three NVIDIA A100 GPUs.  Performance wave evaluated using the WaterDropSample training dataset for 6000 training steps.  Tests were performed using the recommended `nccl` DDP backend.  Results of the strong-scaling test, see \autoref{fig:gns-scaling}, show strong performance.

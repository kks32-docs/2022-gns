# Summary

Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) has emerged as a highly impactful sub-field of machine learning focused on non-Euclidean data structures, such as graphs [@sanchez2020learning,battaglia2018relational]. Graphs are powerful data representations of many real-world applications, including particulate systems, material sciences, drug discovery, astrophysics, and engineering. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)[scarselli2008graph] are state-of-the-art GDL algorithms operating on graphs to represent rich relational information and local vertex features.
